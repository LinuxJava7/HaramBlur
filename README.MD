## Introduction

HaramBlur utilizes face detection and NSFW content detection to uphold the Islamic gaze protection principle. It allows you to tailor your online experience by automatically blurring images and videos containing unwanted or impermissible content.

## Features

- Works on images and videos with unwanted content
- Configurable detection settings for a personalized browsing experience
- Interactive pop-up for easy on/off toggling
- Customizable hover to unblur feature
- Works on most websites and social media platforms

## How it Works

HaramBlur uses face detection and recognition features provided by [Human library](https://github.com/vladmandic/human) and NSFW detection from [nsfwjs](https://github.com/infinitered/nsfwjs/). Configure detection type, blur amount, hover to unblur, or toggle the extension via the interactive pop-up.
